Thus, we believe that model-based monitoring, which has the potential for detecting unknown attacks, is more feasible for control networks than for general enterprise networks.

In this paper we present an innovative approach to the design of Intrusion Detection Systems. The aim is to be able to detect complex attacks to SCADA systems, by monitoring its state evolution. By complex attack, we mean attacks composed of a set of commands that, while licit when considered in isolation on a single-packet basis, can disrupt the correct behavior of the system when executed in particular operating states. The proposed IDS detects these complex attacks thanks to an internal representation of the controlled SCADA system. We also present the corresponding rule language powerful enough to express the system's critical states. Furthermore, we present a prototype of the proposed IDS, able to monitor systems using the ModBus and DNP3 communication protocols.},

@article{Goldenberg2013,
abstract = {The Modbus/TCP protocol is commonly used in SCADA systems for communications between a human-machine interface (HMI) and programmable logic controllers (PLCs). This paper presents a model-based intrusion detection system designed specifically for Modbus/TCP networks. The approach is based on the key observation that Modbus traffic to and from a specific PLC is highly periodic; as a result, each HMI-PLC channel can be modeled using its own unique deterministic finite automaton (DFA). An algorithm is presented that can automatically construct the DFA associated with an HMI-PLC channel based on about 100 captured messages. The resulting DFA-based intrusion detection system looks deep into Modbus/TCP packets and produces a very detailed traffic model. This approach is very sensitive and is able to flag anomalies such as a message appearing out of its position in the normal sequence or a message referring to a single unexpected bit. The intrusion detection approach is tested on a production Modbus system. Despite its high sensitivity, the system has a very low false positive rate-perfect matches of the model to the traffic were observed for five of the seven PLCs tested without a single false alarm over 111. h of operation. Furthermore, the intrusion detection system successfully flagged real anomalies that were caused by technicians who were troubleshooting the HMI system. The system also helped identify a PLC that was configured incorrectly. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

IDS are an essential component of the network to be secured. The traditional IDS are unable to manage various newly arising attacks. To deal with these new problems of networks, data mining based IDS are opening new research avenues. Data mining is used to identify new patterns which were not known previously from large volume of network dataset. New Intrusion Detection Systems are based on sophisticated algorithms in spite of signature based detection. Data mining method uses binary classifiers and multiboosting simultaneously. Features are selected using binary classifiers for more accuracy in each type of attack. Multiboosting is used to reduce both the variance and bias. With data mining, it is easy to identify valid, useful and understandable pattern in large volume of data. Thus the efficiency and accuracy of Intrusion Detection system are increased and security of network so is also enhanced.},

abstract = {Whenever an intrusion occurs, the security and value of a computer system is compromised. Network-based attacks make it difficult for legitimate users to access various network services by purposely occupying or sabotaging network resources and services. This can be done by sending large amounts of network traffic, exploiting well-known faults in networking services, and by overloading network hosts. Intrusion Detection attempts to detect computer attacks by examining various data records observed in processes on the network and it is split into two groups, anomaly detection systems and misuse detection systems. Anomaly detection is an attempt to search for malicious behavior that deviates from established normal patterns. Misuse detection is used to identify intrusions that match known attack scenarios. Our interest here is in anomaly detection and our proposed method is a scalable solution for detecting network-based anomalies. We use Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification. The SVM is one of the most successful classification algorithms in the data mining area, but its long training time limits its use. This paper presents a study for enhancing the training time of SVM, specifically when dealing with large data sets, using hierarchical clustering analysis. We use the Dynamically Growing Self-Organizing Tree (DGSOT) algorithm for clustering because it has proved to overcome the drawbacks of traditional hierarchical clustering algorithms (e.g., hierarchical agglomerative clustering). Clustering analysis helps find the boundary points, which are the most qualified data points to train SVM, between two classes. We present a new approach of combination of SVM and DGSOT, which starts with an initial training set and expands it gradually using the clustering structure produced by the DGSOT algorithm. We compare our approach with the Rocchio Bundling technique and random selection in terms of accuracy loss and training time gain using a single benchmark real data set. We show that our proposed variations contribute significantly in improving the training process of SVM with high generalization accuracy and outperform the Rocchio Bundling technique.},

abstract = {In the current national critical infrastructures, SCADA systems and networks are playing very important roles. Unfortunately, most of closed-network SCADA systems have been considered as very secure against cyber-attacks. Because they use their own operating systems and communication/ network protocols, and their private networks are physically isolated from the public networks and the Internet. However, in case the closed SCADA system has m-connected status due to its maintenance, updates, and patches, it is no longer perfectly secure against cyber-attacks. This paper analyzes vulnerabilities of m-connected SCADA networks and proposes a novel security model for detecting network anomalies. The proposed model is based on an intrusion detection system using the network-based pattern reference method, which has two kinds of rule sets - one is the base rule set, and the other is dynamically produced rule set. The basic rule set can be set with pre-known intrusion patterns, and a dynamically produced new rule set can be set by detecting network anomalies under specific threshold values. Such new rule set would be adapted to the pattern reference model in its next execution time. Therefore, the proposed security model can identify abnormal command execution more effectively and efficiently.},

We describe our approaches to address three types of issues: accuracy,
efficiency, and usability. To improve accuracy, data mining programs are
used to analyze audit data and extract features that can distinguish
normal activities from intrusions; we use artificial anomalies along
with normal and/or intrusion data to produce more effective misuse and
anomaly detection models. To improve efficiency, the computational costs
of features are analyzed and a multiple-model cost-based approach is
used to produce detection models with low cost and high accuracy. We
also present a distributed architecture for evaluating cost-sensitive
models in real-time. To improve usability, adaptive learning algorithms
are used to facilitate model construction and incremental updates;
unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms are used to reduce the
reliance on labeled data. We also present an architecture consisting of
sensors, detectors, a data warehouse, and model generation components.
This architecture facilitates the sharing and storage of audit data and
the distribution of new or updated models. This architecture also

Without proper customization for the special requirements of the industrial control system network environment, many existing anomaly or misuse detection systems will perform sub-optimally.

abstract = {As advances in networking technology help to connect the distant corners of the globe and as the Internet continues to expand its influence as a medium for communications and commerce, the threat from spammers, attackers and criminal enterprises has also grown accordingly. It is the prevalence of such threats that has made intrusion detection systems-the cyberspace's equivalent to the burglar alarm-join ranks with firewalls as one of the fundamental technologies for network security. However, today's commercially available intrusion detection systems are predominantly signature-based intrusion detection systems that are designed to detect known attacks by utilizing the signatures of those attacks. Such systems require frequent rule-base updates and signature updates, and are not capable of detecting unknown attacks. In contrast, anomaly detection systems, a subset of intrusion detection systems, model the normal system/network behavior which enables them to be extremely effective in finding and foiling both known as well as unknown or "zero day" attacks. While anomaly detection systems are attractive conceptually, a host of technological problems need to be overcome before they can be widely adopted. These problems include: high false alarm rate, failure to scale to gigabit speeds, etc. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of anomaly detection systems and hybrid intrusion detection systems of the recent past and present. We also discuss recent technological trends in anomaly detection and identify open problems and challenges in this area. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Most critical infrastructure such as chemical processing plants, electrical generation and distribution networks, and gas distribution is monitored and controlled by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition Systems (SCADA. These systems have been the focus of increased security and there are concerns that they could be the target of international terrorists. With the constantly growing number of internet related computer attacks, there is evidence that our critical infrastructure may also be vulnerable. Researchers estimate that malicious online actions may cause \$75 billion at 2007. One of the interesting countermeasures for enhancing information system security is called intrusion detection. This paper will briefly discuss the history of research in intrusion detection techniques and introduce the two basic detection approaches: signature detection and anomaly detection. Finally, it presents the application of techniques developed for monitoring critical process systems, such as nuclear power plants, to anomaly intrusion detection. The method uses an autoassociative kernel regression (AAKR) model coupled with the statistical probability ratio test (SPRT) and applied to a simulated SCADA system. The results show that these methods can be generally used to detect a variety of common attacks.},

As the action of intrusion represents variable, complicated, and uncertainty characteristic, they face so many problems to resolve for intrusion detection.

We discusses the differences in host- and network-based intrusion detection techniques to demonstrate how the two can work together to provide additionally effective intrusion detection and protection. We propose a hybrid IDS, which combines network and host IDS, with anomaly and misuse detection mode, utilizes auditing programs to extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection or host session, and applies data mining programs to learn rules that accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities.},
