abstract = {In a model-based intrusion detection approach for protecting SCADA networks, we construct models that characterize the expected/acceptable behavior of the system, and detect attacks that cause violations of these models. Process control networks tend to have static topologies, regular traffic patterns, and a limited number of applications and protocols running on them. Thus, we believe that model-based monitoring, which has the potential for detecting unknown attacks, is more feasible for control networks than for general enterprise networks. To this end, we describe three model-based techniques that we have developed and a prototype implementation of them for monitoring Modbus TCP networks.},

abstract = {Simulation experiment is an important means of analyzing and assessing the security of SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system, however, the existing simulation environments have some limitations in flexibility and extensibility. According to the type of industrial infrastructure and the structure of SCADA system, the abstract models of SCADA system are established, the reference architecture of SCADA system simulation environment is proposed, and the simulation environment for analyzing and assessing the security of SCADA system is designed and implemented. This simulation environment has the characteristics of extensibilities and adaptability, and integrated several components including the simulated enterprise network, OPC Client/HMI, industrial OPC server, SCADA protocol tester, SCADA RTUs, and the sensors and actuators, etc. Finally, experiment on the representative SCADA system attack scenario of has been conducted in this simulation environment to analyze and assess their security status, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the simulation environment.},

@article{Garitano2011,
abstract = {The security of critical infrastructures is decreasing due to the apparition of new cyber threats against Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The evolution they have experienced; the use of standard hardware and software components or the increase of interconnected devices in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency, have contributed to this. This work reviews the research effort done towards the development of anomaly detection for these specific systems. SCADA systems have a number of peculiarities that make anomaly detection perform better than in traditional information and communications technology (ICT) networks. SCADA communications are deterministic, and their operation model is often cyclical. Based on this premise, modeling normal behavior by mining specific features gets feasible. \&copy; 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

@article{Lee2001,
abstract = {We present an overview of our research in real time data
mining-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs). We focus on issues
related to deploying a data mining-based IDS in a real time environment.
We describe our approaches to address three types of issues: accuracy,
efficiency, and usability. To improve accuracy, data mining programs are
used to analyze audit data and extract features that can distinguish
normal activities from intrusions; we use artificial anomalies along
with normal and/or intrusion data to produce more effective misuse and
anomaly detection models. To improve efficiency, the computational costs
of features are analyzed and a multiple-model cost-based approach is
used to produce detection models with low cost and high accuracy. We
also present a distributed architecture for evaluating cost-sensitive
models in real-time. To improve usability, adaptive learning algorithms
are used to facilitate model construction and incremental updates;
unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms are used to reduce the
reliance on labeled data. We also present an architecture consisting of
sensors, detectors, a data warehouse, and model generation components.
This architecture facilitates the sharing and storage of audit data and
the distribution of new or updated models. This architecture also
improves the efficiency and scalability of the IDS},
