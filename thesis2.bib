abstract = {Increasing awareness of ICS security issues has brought about a growing body of work in this area, including pioneering contributions based on realistic control system logs and network traces. This paper surveys the state of the art in ICS security research, including efforts of industrial researchers, highlighting the most interesting works. Research efforts are grouped into divergent areas, where we add “secure control” as a new category to capture security goals specific to control systems that differ from security goals in traditional IT systems.},

@article{Zhu2010,
abstract = {Due to standardization and connectivity to the Internet, Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems now face the threat of cyber attacks. SCADA systems were designed without cyber security in mind and hence the problem of how to modify conventional Information Technology (IT) intrusion detection techniques to suit the needs of SCADA is a big challenge. They explain the nuance associated with the task of SCADA-specific intrusion detection and frame it in the domain interest of control engineers and researchers to illuminate the problem space. The authors present taxonomy and a set of metrics for SCADA-specific intrusion detection techniques by heightening their possible use in SCADA systems.},

abstract = {Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition(SCADA) systems are deeply ingrained in the fabric of critical infrastructure sectors. These computerized real-time process control systems, over geographically dispersed continuous distribution operations, are increasingly subject to serious damage and disruption by cyber means due to their standardization and connectivity to other networks. However, SCADA systems generally have little protection from the escalating cyber threats. In order to understand the potential danger and to protect SCADA systems, in this paper, we highlight their difference from standard IT systems and present a set of security property goals. Furthermore, we focus on systematically identifying and classifying likely cyber attacks including cyber-induced cyber-physical attack son SCADA systems. Determined by the impact on control performance of SCADA systems, the attack categorization criteria highlights commonalities and important features of such attacks that define unique challenges posed to securing SCADA systems versus traditional Information Technology(IT) systems.},
